# The Beginning of Bun

Soon I will begin designing Bun, a programming language with aims to mitigate confusion for code readers by providing a unique syntax for name binding and identifier resolution.

The project is part of my capstone research assignment for Software Engineering at Media Design School, New Zealand.

Development will last for five or six weeks.
