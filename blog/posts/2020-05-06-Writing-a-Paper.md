# Writing a Paper

Notes I took from the video https://youtu.be/UY7sVKJPTMA

## 1. Preliminaries

1. Review and Renew your Literature Search. Before writing paper.
    - Get the data so writing is easy.
2. Audience

## 2. The Big Picture

- Initial draft is CREATIVE
    - Do not fuss
    - Irrelevant perfection

## 3. The Outline

1. List all your figures and tables.
2. Put in order of presentation as they may appear in the results and discussion.
    - Always work from an outline.

## Steps

1. Research
    - Data
    - Tables
    - Figures
2. Define Audience
    - Is the paper a Research/Review/Tutorial?
    - Intended publication journal
    - Undergraduates, researchers, always the reviewers
2. Outline
    - List all figures and tables and data
    - Order of Presentation 
3. Draft
    1. (Forget about introduction for now)
    2. The Experimental
    3. Results and Discussion
4. Critical Editing
    - Make sure the science conveyed is correct
    - Note down needed references (but do not research)
5. Conclusion
    - Bullet Point, 1.2.3.
6. Introduction
    1. Why, purpose
    2. Background info, relevant, central
        - So that the audience can follow along
7. Exact References
