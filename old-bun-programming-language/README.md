# The Bun Programming Language

A programming langugage with emphasis on name binding and identifier resolution.

This was the precursor to the article [NameResolutionInCpp](../NameResolutionInCpp.pdf). I was overly ambitious and tried designing a programming language from scratch. Half way through I pivoted to focusing on just the C++ language, because it would be more beneficial for readers to learn about a common industry standard language than a random new language.
