# Name Resolution in C++

Author: Elijah Shadbolt

Date: 10 June 2020

I wrote the article "[NameResolutionInCpp.pdf](./NameResolutionInCpp.pdf)" for a university capstone project.

It contains many example C++ programs. The source code can be found [here](./source-code-visual-studio/NameResolutionInCpp/) and compiled with Visual Studio (MSVC).

### Old: Bun Programming Language

This was the precursor to the article. I was overly ambitious and tried designing a programming language from scratch. Half way through I pivoted to focusing on just the C++ language, because it would be more beneficial for readers to learn about a common industry standard language than a random new language.

The archived Bun project can be found [here](./old-bun-programming-language/README.md).
